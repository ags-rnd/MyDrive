This file describes a series of rules that should be followed when programming
in this project.

Commentaries:

  - Multiline comments Ã  la JavaDoc

  /**
   * Insert comment here
   * ...
   * End comment here
   */


  - "Inline" commentaries:

  var = someFunc(); // Stores in var something


  This is ok, although, sometimes, this happens:


  int veryLongVariableNameThatIsAssignedWithSomething = something;


  - "Long lines" comments:

  (incorrect)
  int veryLongVariableNameThatIsAssignedWithSomething = something; // a not so long comment

  (correct)
  /** a not so long comment */
  int veryLongVariableNameThatIsAssignedWithSomething = something;


Don't forget to identify methods that are overriden by derived classes with the
keyword: @Override; The compiler appreciates it and so do the people you're
working with. There's nothing more annoying that searching through a bunch of
super classes that you didn't implement to know where the method is actually
defined.

  (Example)
  @Override
  public void foo(){} // some overriden method


Tabstop and shiftwidth of 2:

(correct)
public void main(String [] args){
  if (true){
    ;
  } else {
    ;
  }
  return; // Only two spaces in every indentation level
}


Do not write more than 80 columns per line.


And please, do *not* leave commented code...
